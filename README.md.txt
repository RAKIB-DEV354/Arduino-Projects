ðŸ”¬ Arduino Projects Collection

This repository contains all of my Arduino projects, from beginner to advanced.  
Each project has:
- âœ… Arduino `.ino` code  
- âœ… Circuit diagram (`circuit.png`)  
- âœ… Project-specific README with explanation  
- âœ… Tinkercad simulation link

ðŸ“‚ Project List

1. [Traffic Light](TrafficLight/README.md)  
   Simulates a basic traffic light with red, yellow, and green LEDs.  

2. [LED Fade](LEDFade/README.md)  
   Demonstrates PWM by gradually increasing and decreasing LED brightness.

ðŸ“š Goal
This repo is for learning electronics and building a portfolio of Arduino projects.  
Over time, I will add more projects to track my progress.
