ðŸš¦ Arduino Traffic Light Simulation

ðŸ“Œ Description
This project simulates a simple traffic light system using an Arduino Uno and three LEDs.

---

ðŸ”§ Components
- Arduino Uno
- 1 Ã— Green LED
- 1 Ã— Yellow LED
- 1 Ã— Red LED
- 3 Ã— 220Î© resistors
- Breadboard + jumper wires

---

âš¡ Circuit
Pin connections:
- Pin 13 â†’ Green LED
- Pin 12 â†’ Yellow LED
- Pin 8  â†’ Red LED
- Common GND through resistors

ðŸš¦ How it Works

1. Green LED turns on for 3 seconds (cars go).

2. Green turns off â†’ Yellow LED turns on for 1 second and blinks one time(warning).

3. Yellow turns off â†’ Red LED turns on for 3 seconds (cars stop).

4. The cycle repeats forever, just like a real traffic light.

ðŸ“š Learning

1. Learned how to control multiple digital outputs with digitalWrite().

2. Understood how to simulate real-world systems (traffic lights).

3. Practiced using delay() to control timing between LED states.

ðŸ’» Code
```cpp
void setup()
{
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(12, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(8, OUTPUT);


}

void loop()
{
  
  //Imagine as green
 digitalWrite(13,HIGH);
  delay(3000);
  digitalWrite(13,LOW);
   
  //Imagine as yellow
 digitalWrite(12,HIGH);
  delay(500);
  digitalWrite(12,LOW);
  delay(500);
  
  //Repeat the code to blink twice

   digitalWrite(12,HIGH);
  delay(500);
  digitalWrite(12,LOW);
   
  //Imagine as red
 digitalWrite(8,HIGH);
  delay(3000);
  digitalWrite(8,LOW);
   
  
}
